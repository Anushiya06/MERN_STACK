  <h1>Questions and Answers</h1>
  <p><strong>1. Why is Git not showing the git commit command while adding a file and showing the command for unstage?</strong></p>
  <p>Git shows the unstage command when files are already staged. Use <code>git commit</code> after staging. If files are not staged, use <code>git add</code> to stage them first. Ensure you are in the correct directory.</p>

  <p><strong>2. What is the difference before the first push and after the first push?</strong></p>
  <p>Before the first push, the branch is local. After the first push, it is tracked by the remote repository. This allows collaboration and version control with others. Changes can be pulled and pushed.</p>

  <p><strong>3. How is the title tag fetched to the head and h1 fetched to the body when rendering an HTML file which has no structure?</strong></p>
  <p>The browser automatically places the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> if not structured. This ensures proper document structure and rendering. It follows HTML standards.</p>

  <p><strong>4. What is the difference between href and src and why is it used in img and anchor tags?</strong></p>
  <p><code>href</code> specifies the URL for a link, while <code>src</code> specifies the source for an embedded resource like an image. <code>href</code> is used in anchor tags, and <code>src</code> is used in image tags. They define the destination and source respectively.</p>

  <p><strong>5. Why are there three dots in if...else and do...while?</strong></p>
  <p>The three dots in <code>if...else</code> and <code>do...while</code> indicate omitted code or logic. They are placeholders for additional code that can be added later. It signifies continuation or repetition.</p>

  <p><strong>6. What is the difference between spread and rest operators?</strong></p>
  <p>The spread operator expands elements, while the rest operator collects multiple elements into an array. Spread is used in function calls, and rest is used in function parameters. They handle elements differently in arrays and objects.</p>
